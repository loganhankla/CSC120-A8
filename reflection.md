- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    My class is a Robot class where the user is a human giving the robot orders. I grew up watching the movie, "I, Robot," and I recently started listening to the audiobook. My dad is a huge Isaac Asimov fan, so I've been in a kick with it, too, so when I saw the interface, I knew what I had to do. This class is fairly simple for a robot, of course, but I had fun putting the Three Laws in there.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I added an additional two overloaded undo() methods that take one or two parameters. This allowed me to reverse several of the methods. The method used depended on how many parameters were put in (whether or not the original method has input).

I also included a stab() method just for fun to throw an exception if the robot was asked to stab (harm) a human because that would violate the Three Laws of Robotics. It only works if the "item" includes the word human, so it won't catch if the human is referred to by name.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Putting my ideas into comments as little notes is always really helpful for me to get down my ideas before I can formulate it into actual functioning code. Starting early was again helpful! I felt pretty good on this assignment and didn't actually feel the need to go to office hours or TA hours, but I think having gone in the past and starting early enough that I would have time to go if I needed to was helpful. Being creative with this one was good. I would tell future students to start having fun with the assignments! Especially on this one where we're given more creativity.
